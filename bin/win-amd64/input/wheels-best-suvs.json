      What does SUV stand for? \n SUV is an abbreviation of “Sport Utility Vehicle.” Though the roots of Sports Utility Vehicles trace back to truck-based military personnel, light combat vehicles and industrial trucks, most experts agree the 1963 Jeep Wagoneer was the first commercially available sports utility vehicle. Like a station wagon, it provided room for passengers in the front with ample cargo space in the back for the attendant gear of the emerging middle-class post-war suburban family. However, unlike a station wagon, the sport utility was built on a rugged trucklike frame and offered four-wheel drive as its marquee option; just the thing to get to those remote camping and fishing spots or make it through a snow squall en route to the slopes. But it was also capable of a day’s work, offering increased tow ratings, the capability to mount a plow in the front and providing safe, secure transport for home improvement supplies and tools in the back.  \n The first use of the “SUV” abbreviation is generally credited to a Jeep Cherokee advertising brochure from 1974; traditionally, SUV is still reserved for body-on-frame vehicles like  Jeep Grand Wagoneer  and  Chevrolet Suburban . Since then, the term SUV—or some form of it—has been stretched to have a much broader definition, including smaller unibody vehicles like the  Jeep Grand Cherokee . The proliferation of SUV-like vehicles in the late twentieth century gave rise to the term crossover to help delineate between truck-based and car-based vehicles.  \n\n What is a crossover SUV? \n A crossover SUV, sometimes abbreviated as “CUV,” or simply “crossover,” is a vehicle that combines the attributes of a traditional car with those of an SUV. Toyota is believed to have coined the term with the introduction of its RAV4 in the mid-1990s. Originally a stand-alone descriptor, marketers started adding “SUV” in an effort to create a broader understanding and appeal.  \n Marketing aside, crossover generally refers to a unibody vehicle (unit construction instead of a body-on-frame like a full-size truck or SUV) that features a hatchback or small wagon body style, a slightly higher ride height, all-wheel drive, semi-rugged design cues and often an outdoorsy or clever naming scheme. Often, a crossover shares a platform and some of its mechanical and interior components with a traditional sedan or hatchback counterpart, leading industry insiders to refer to crossovers as “car-based SUVs.”  \n Whereas some crossovers are essentially hatchbacks with added ground clearance, some crossovers—the  Ford Bronco Sport ,  Jeep Renegade  and  Toyota RAV4 , to name a few—are actually pretty competent when the pavement ends.  \n\n How we group types of SUVs \n Compact (small?), Midsize, Large \n Forbes Wheels groups SUVs and crossovers into subcompact, compact, midsize and full-size segments. Though the lines have begun to blur due to the sheer volume of SUVs and crossovers flooding the market, the subcompact segment represents the smallest offerings available in the U.S., vehicles which generally measure less than 173.2 inches in length. This includes the  Honda HR-V ,  Hyundai Kona  and  Nissan Kicks . Occasionally industry sources will refer to this as the “B-SUV” segment in relation to the B-Segmet that refers to subcompact cars. The compact crossover SUV segment, sometimes called C-CUV or C-SUV, is one of the largest and most popular extant. It includes the best-selling  Toyota RAV4 , the  Honda CR-V  and  Chevrolet Equinox . These vehicles are typically under 185 inches in length.      \n Midsize crossovers and SUVs parallel the traditional passenger car midsize D-segment. Though some stretch a tad long, the segment includes vehicles like the  Toyota Highlander ,  Kia Sorrento  and  Mazda CX-9 . Even the  Ford Explorer  slips beneath the 200.8-inch maximum length generally used to limit this class.  \n Finally, full-Size crossovers and SUVs encompass the end of the segment that Americans seem to lust after, vehicles longer than 200 inches long. Of course, that includes body-on-frame leviathans like the  Chevrolet Suburban ,  Ford Expedition  and  Jeep Grand Wagoneer , but even unibody models like the  Chevrolet Traverse  are considered full-size.  \n\n Luxury vs non luxury \n Determining luxury vs. non-luxury is largely a function of price and market positioning. At Forbes Wheels, we refer to “premium” brands as the makers who take a holistic approach to blending together the type of features, materials, design, and assembly process to create an elevated owner experience. This includes legacy players like Mercedes-Benz and BMW and upstarts like Genesis. The higher price point theoretically allows the maker to increase quality in all metrics, something we consider when evaluating these vehicles. \n\n How we rank SUVs: \n For 2022, our seven rating categories are: \n \n Performance \n Fuel Economy \n Safety \n Infotainment \n Comfort \u0026 Room \n Cargo Space \u0026 Storage \n Style \u0026 Design \n \n Overall: 100 points \n \n Performance (15 points)  The Performance score is a   subjective assessment of a vehicle’s handling, braking, acceleration, ride quality and other qualitative performance measures such as horsepower, torque, zero-to-60 time and top speed. Towing capability for trucks and SUVs also is considered. Performance of the vehicles is compared against the identified competitive set. While driving, reviewers look for attributes relative to the expectations set by the manufacturer and by consumer expectations. \n Fuel Economy (15 points)  The Fuel Economy score is based on the combined mpg estimate for the entire model lineup and how that figure measures against the identified competitive set. The mpg estimates are based on EPA data or the manufacturer if no EPA data is available. Hybrid and plug-in electric variants within a lineup that significantly lower their overall average will not be included in the comparison unless the competitive set also has hybrid or PHEV variants. Scoring for pure electric vehicles will be based on kilowatts consumed per 100 miles and the comparative mile per gallon equivalent, or MPGe.   \n Safety (15 points)  The Safety score is based on crash test results from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Vehicles not yet rated by either agency receive zero points. Also included in the safety rating are points awarded for certain advanced driver-assistance safety features offered as standard equipment on the base trim. There are nine safety features Forbes Wheels considers mandatory for the standard offering: forward emergency automatic braking, forward collision warning, automatic high beams, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic warning, adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning or one its higher-level variants, lane keeping assistance or lane centering. Vehicles must have at least four of these in their standard offering to receive points. Vehicles that offer a Level 2 self-driving system, (a combination of adaptive cruise control and lane centering) are eligible for a bonus point. \n Infotainment (15 points)  The Infotainment score is based on points awarded for certain features offered as standard equipment on the base trim. Forbes Wheels identifies certain features that are growing in popularity and therefore have been adopted by both premium and mainstream automakers. Some of these features include a minimum 7-inch touchscreen (or premium vehicles that use a rotary knob, touchpad or other mechanism to control a non-touchscreen display), wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a customizable, digital driver information display or instrument panel and at least 2 USB ports. Additional points are awarded for popular features that haven’t been widely adopted in mainstream vehicles such as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and wireless charging capabilities. \n Comfort \u0026 Room (15 points)  The Comfort \u0026 Room score is based on points awarded for the reviewer’s assessment of the vehicle’s comfort, ergonomics and overall interior feel as well as effective use of space. Points also are awarded for the measurement of rear-seat legroom and how it compares with the identified competitive set. Vehicles that offer a segment-best legroom in either rear seat or optional third row are eligible for a bonus point. \n Cargo Space \u0026 Storage (15 points)  The Cargo Space \u0026 Storage score is based on points awarded for the reviewer’s assessment of the vehicle’s large and small cargo spaces (as well as small-item storage) and how well they serve their purpose and effective use of space. Reviewers also consider innovative storage solutions and flexible loading features. Points also are awarded for the cargo space measurements for rear cargo hold or trunk and how it compares with the identified competitive set. Vehicles that offer a segment-best cargo or trunk space are eligible for a bonus point. \n Styling (10 points)  The Performance score is a   subjective assessment of a vehicle’s overall styling and design, inside and out. Reviewers also consider the configuration of the interior and how well the design plays into the function. Build quality also is a consideration.  \n \n\n\n                 \n                 \n     \n         Related Articles \n     \n     \n                     \n                 \n                 2024
