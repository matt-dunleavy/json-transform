Before getting behind the wheel, a few details require your attention. Key among them is registering your car or truck with your state, as it is illegal to drive without it.\n \n \n  Here’s how vehicle registration works and how to  register your car . \n \n \n Key Takeaways \n Cars and trucks must be registered in all 50 U.S. states. Costs vary state by state and generally range from $30 to $50. Registration expires after a year or two depending on the state. It’s your job to keep it current. Penalties for not registering your vehicle range in the hundreds of dollars. To register your car, you’ll typically need to show title or lien information, a bill of sale, and proof of insurance. \n    What Is Vehicle Registration?     \n  In the U.S., car owners must register their vehicles with their state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or transportation department. You must do this when buying a vehicle, moving to another state, or renewing your registration before it expires. \n \n \n  States use registrations to determine vehicle ownership and provide data when tracking a criminal or assessing taxes. A registration certificate and license plates are issued after paying a fee. \n \n \n \n Your vehicle’s registration certificate is essential and must be on hand whenever you’re behind the wheel. Law enforcement will demand to see it if you’re stopped. \n    Cost of Registering Your Vehicle    \n  The cost to register your new car varies by state but generally ranges from $30 to $50. Here are a few examples: \n \n \n   Nevada:  $33 base registration fee, renewed annually Pennsylvania:  $39 base registration fee, renewed annually Hawaii:  $45 state fee, plus registration fee based on weight of vehicle, renewed annually Texas:  $50.75 base registration fee which increases by the weight of the vehicle, renewed annually \n \n \n   Renewal is required every one to three years, depending on your state’s laws. \n \n \n    Penalties for Not Registering Your Car    \n  The vehicle must be registered for you to legally drive it. If you are in an accident or stopped by law enforcement, you’ll be asked to show your license,  proof of insurance , and registration certificate. If you don’t have a current registration certificate with you, you could be fined or your vehicle could be impounded. \n \n \n  Fines may also apply for late registration renewal. Examples of penalties:\n \n \n   Maine:  If you live in Maine, fines range from $200 to $1,000. You can also be issued a traffic infraction. Vermont:  Drivers in Vermont who fail to register their vehicles and present a current registration certificate when asked by law enforcement face penalties of $100 to $250 for a first offense. For a second violation, penalties range from $250 to $500. \n \n \n    How to Register Your Car    \n  Though the requirements vary by state, you’ll generally need to present the following documents at the DMV when you register your vehicle: \n \n \n \n Title or lien:  If you own the vehicle outright, you’ll be asked to show its  title . If the car is financed, you must show the lien agreement.  \n Bill of sale:  When you buy a new car from a dealership, they issue a bill of sale. This document must be presented to register the vehicle.  \n Odometer reading:  In some cases, a DMV representative will check the odometer when you bring the car for registration. Other states permit the owner to report the vehicle’s mileage. \n Proof of insurance:  Most states require  car insurance  that meets state minimum liability requirements. Be ready to show an insurance card when you register.  \n Identification:  You need a current driver’s license in good standing to register a car.  \n Method of payment:  To pay registration or renewal fees, bring cash, check, or credit card.  \n \n \n   Why Do State Require Vehicle Registrations? \n Each state varies slightly in its requirement and process. but registrations allow states to track the number of vehicles registered, the condition of the vehicles, and if they are insured. \n \n \n   How Is a Car Registration Different From a Car Title? \n A car title shows who owns the vehicle and if a bank has a lien on that vehicle. The registration is a legal document with the state where the owner resides and shows the vehicle meets that state's requirements to be driven legally. \n \n \n   What Is the Difference Between a VIN and a Vehicle Registration? \n VIN stands for  vehicle identification number , and each vehicle has a unique number. This allows vehicles to be distinguished from one another and identifies the specific vehicle that an individual owns. As well, when registering a vehicle with the state, the VIN makes it clear precisely which vehicle is being registered. \n \n \n    The Bottom Line    \n  There are several important steps to take after purchasing a vehicle, whether new or used, and registering it with your state is one of them. Make sure you understand how often to renew the registration to avoid penalties.\n \n \n  Don't forget to visit your state DMV or Department of Transportation website, as it varies by state, for detailed information about the requirements, fees, and penalties for not having a current registration certificate. \n \n \n \n \n \n Article Sources \n \n \n \n Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
