Although Elon Musk is now inextricably linked with Tesla, he only joined the company a year after its inception. He invested $30 million into Tesla, became the chairman of its Board of Directors, and helped raise money from Google’s founders several years later.  \n The prototype for the Tesla Roadster, the company’s first electric car, was unveiled in 2006 and entered production in 2008.  Through June 2009, 500 Roadsters were sold for  $98,000 apiece .  \n In 2017, Tesla tapped into the mainstream market by launching its Model 3 vehicle, which became the world’s most popular plug-in electric car in 2020, with worldwide unit sales of roughly  501,000  in 2021. Between January and March 2022, Tesla broke its own delivery record, when its car deliveries crossed the  310,000-unit  threshold.   \n \n \n \n Tesla Earnings 💰💹 \n Interested to see how Tesla is currently performing?

Its revenue for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022, was $81.462 billion, which amounts to a 51.35% growth year-over-year. In 2022, the company’s hourly revenue amounted to $8,703,704; in 2012, it made ‘only’ $13,981 per hour. \n Year (since 2009) Annual Revenue (Millions of US $) 2009 $112 2010 $117 2011 $204 2012 $413 2013 $2,013 2014 $3,198 2015 $4,046 2016 $7,000 2017 $11,759 2018 $21,461 2019 $24,578 2020 $31,536 2021 $53,823 2022 $81,462 \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n   \n  Tesla Q1 2024 Earnings   \n   Copied       Copy To Clipboard       \n Tesla reported its 2024 first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 23, with EPS of $0.45, $0.04 worse than the analyst estimate of $0.49. Revenue for the quarter came in at $21.3B versus the consensus estimate of $22.27B. \n “It’s a  bittersweet  report for Tesla bulls as, on the one hand, the  EV giant missed financial expectations  by a wider margin than initially expected, both on the revenue and the margins front,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. “However, on the other hand, Elon finally presented investors with a  feasible plan  to turn things around in the key markets where the company can potentially show the greatest growth. Amid the current price war, particularly in China – and with the prospects of the company venturing into the Indian market – the word “affordable” resonated as music to the ears of shareholders. \n “This means the company may just be able to use its  gigantic production capacity  more efficiently while maintaining the original proposal of its higher-end models. Moreover, it also speaks to the fears that inventory buildups could continue to pressure margins for the year ahead,” he continued. “The announcement also indicates that Elon may be focusing efforts on the EV giant again, which is another piece of good news for shareholders. It’s a promising sign for the company that Elon felt compelled to change its direction amid the myriad of pressures.” \n Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at  Investing.com . \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n   \n  Tesla’s Achievements in 2022  \n   Copied       Copy To Clipboard       \n While other automakers delivered their worst sales figures in a decade, Tesla’s delivery statistics were praiseworthy in 2022. The company delivered 1,313,851 vehicles to customers worldwide and, in so doing, increased its deliveries by 40% in comparison to the previous year. It also produced 47% more cars in 2022 compared to 2021. \n By selling 491,000 vehicles in America, Tesla won the US luxury sales leader title. It left behind BMW, which had worn this crown for the last three years but sold only 332,388 cars in the United States in 2022 and was thus relegated to second place. With 286,764 cars sold, Mercedez-Benz came third, followed by Lexus, whose sales totaled 258,704 vehicles in 2022. And not only did Tesla outshine these brands, but it also became the first American automaker to top the list in a quarter century. \n There is also another point to Tesla’s credit. Because Tesla produces its cars on American soil, in California and Texas, it strengthens American automaking. With Elon Musk, American car manufacturing has made a spectacular comeback. \n In 2022, Tesla also expanded its international factories. In March, the first Tesla vehicles were produced in Germany at the newly opened Giga Berlin. Musk’s idea is to turn Giga Berlin into a European crown jewel. The factory in China was also updated to manufacture as many as 750,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric cars annually. During 2022, Tesla installed the capacity, across all of its factories, to produce 100,000 Model S and X vehicles per year, together with 1.8 million Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. \n In late 2022, Tesla cut prices on its cars around the world. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom became less expensive. By enabling more people to purchase its cars, Tesla accelerated the world’s transition to sustainable energy. \n Want to buy Tesla stock? 🚘📈 \n Invest in Tesla shares quickly and without hidden charges by checking out our list of the  top online brokers  and  best trading platforms .

Analysts predict that Tesla’s rapid growth can accelerate in the third quarter and beyond. Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk mentioned the company’s future production plans, saying that by the end of 2022, Tesla might reach an annual production run rate of  2 million vehicles : \n “We’re aiming to achieve a  2 million vehicle  run-rate by the end of the year… Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla team, we’ve already been able to achieve a  1.5 million unit  annualized run rate. And depending on how the rest of this year goes, I think we might get close to, or will get approximately at the  1.5 million  mark, and will be exiting the year at a  2 million-unit  run-rate,” Musk said. \n In the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla delivered nearly 405,300 units. Its quarterly deliveries grew by 17.87% during this quarter, compared to the same quarter of 2021. Between November and December 2022, Tesla’s deliveries crossed the 405,000 unit mark, setting a new record. The deliveries in the third quarter of 2022 totaled 343,000. Overall, in 2022, Tesla delivered 1,313,851 and produced 1,369,611 units. Since 2018, Tesla has delivered 3,382,821 and has produced 3,429,532 cars. \n The company also said that the factory in Shanghai allows it to manufacture 750,000 Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles a year. The production capacity of Tesla’s factory in California lets it annually make 100,000 more expensive Model S and Model X cars together with 550,000 of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The company’s Texas factory can produce 250,000 Model Y vehicles annually, and so can its factory in Germany. \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n   \n  Tesla’s 2022 Year-End Vehicle Production and Delivery  \n   Copied       Copy To Clipboard       \n Tesla opened the new year by publishing its fourth-quarter vehicle production and 2022 delivery report on January 3, 2023. Total annual deliveries reached a new record of 1.31 million, increasing by 47% compared to the last year. Total annual production hit 1.37 million. The most popular vehicle of the year proved Model 3s, comprising over 95% of produced and delivered cars. \n The Q4 deliveries and production could have been more impressive. Their numbers fell short of analysts’ consensus, who expected Tesla to deliver around 427,000 cars. Contrary to analysts’ predictions, Tesla delivered 405,278 vehicles and produced 439,000 cars in the fourth quarter. The period ending December 31, 2022, was challenging for the company because of Covid outbreaks in China, leading to reduced production at its Shanghai factory. Yet Elon Musk sounded optimistic when he said he expected to achieve “50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon.” \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n   \n  How Many Tesla Vehicles Are Sold by Country?  \n   Copied       Copy To Clipboard       \n Tesla sold and delivered the majority of its vehicles in China in 2021.

Considering that in 2011, TSLA shares cost a mere  $4.92 , the company has done exceptionally well since its inception. Although Tesla faces tough competition from other automakers, some of its EVs are on top of the electric vehicle market. It is the only company that simultaneously has several top-selling cars, such as Tesla Model Y ( 32.9%  market share) and Tesla Model 3 ( 22.6% ) and, therefore, might easily outclass and outsell other producers of electric vehicles. \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n   \n  InvestingPro: Unlock Additional Tesla Data  \n   Copied       Copy To Clipboard       \n Use The InvestingPro Stock Screener To Outsmart The Market! 🛠️📈 \n Compare the performance of  Tesla  against industry leaders, access vital financial stats and make smarter investment moves.  \n Say goodbye to inefficiency – choose InvestingPro for swift  Tesla insights  and more profitable decisions within minutes of  signing up . \n \n \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n \n Related Recent \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Samsung: Empowering Athletes with Mobile Innovations   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n A Statistical Analysis of Nike’s Rise to the Top of the Sporting Industry   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Adidas: Pushing Sports Performance Further and Further with Ground-Breaking Technology   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Amazon: The World’s Most Powerful Economic and Cultural Force   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Apple Inc.: Our Modern-Day Symbol of Knowledge, Power, and Wealth   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Berkshire Hathaway: The World’s Largest Holding Company   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n CMC Markets: An Analytical Exploration of its Facts, Statistics, and Future Outlook   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Discover The World of Plus500: A Comprehensive Guide    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Elon Musk Facts: History, Achievements and Net Worth   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Facebook: The Leading Social Platform of Our Times   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Best Cheap Stocks Under $10 with High Upside   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Who Is Ray Dalio: Net Worth, Quotes, And The Bridgewater Story   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n What Is the Wash-Sale Rule?   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n What Is a Black Swan Event?   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Top Dividend Stocks (June 2024)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n Best Large-Cap Growth Stocks (June 2024)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n What Is An Accredited Investor?
